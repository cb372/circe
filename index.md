circe (pronounced SUR-see, or KEER-kee in classical Greek, or CHEER-chay in Ecclesiastical Latin) is
a JSON library for Scala (and [Scala.js][scala-js]).

circe's working title was jfc, which stood for "JSON for [cats][cats]". The name was changed for 
[a number of reasons](https://github.com/travisbrown/circe/issues/11).
